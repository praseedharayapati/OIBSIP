The above code presents an simple calculator that allows users to perform arithmetic calculations using both mouse clicks and keyboard input. The calculator's 
interface comprises a text input field and a grid of buttons, representing numbers, basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), special functions (e.g., square, square root, 
cube root, reciprocal), a backspace button, and an equal sign (=) for calculation.

The JavaScript code handles user interactions and input validation. When the user clicks on a button, the corresponding operator or number is 
added to the calculation expression displayed in the input field. Input validation ensures that only valid characters (numbers and operators) are added to the 
calculation, and any other characters are ignored.
The calculator supports keyboard input, allowing users to type numbers, operators, Enter key (for calculation), and Backspace key (for backspace functionality). 
Invalid characters or keys are blocked from being inputted, maintaining a consistent and reliable user experience.
The calculator also includes special functions like square, square root, cube root, and reciprocal, allowing users to perform more complex calculations with ease. 
When the user clicks the equal sign (=) or presses the Enter key, the calculator evaluates the entered expression and displays the result in the input field.

Overall, this calculator provides users with a straightforward and accessible way to perform basic arithmetic calculations while 
ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
