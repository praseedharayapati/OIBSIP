1. HTML Structure:
   - The code defines a basic HTML structure with a title, header, and three main sections: "Add Task Form," "To-Do List," and "Completed Tasks."

2. CSS Styling:
   - The CSS styling is responsible for the overall appearance of the application. It sets up the layout, colors, fonts, and styles for various elements, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

3. JavaScript Functionality:
   - The JavaScript code manages the dynamic behavior of the To-Do List. It performs the following key functionalities:
     a. Rendering the To-Do List: The `renderTodoList()` function displays both active and completed tasks on the web page by creating appropriate HTML elements for each task.
     b. Adding a Task: The `addTask()` function allows users to add a new task by entering a task description and a future deadline. It performs input validation to ensure valid input before adding the task to the active task list.
     c. Editing a Task: The `toggleEdit()` function enables the edit mode for a task, allowing users to modify the task's description.
     d. Saving Edited Task: The `saveEditedTask()` function saves the edited task and updates it in the active task list.
     e. Deleting a Task: The `deleteTodoItem()` function allows users to delete an active task, and the `deleteCompletedTask()` function allows users to delete a completed task from the completed task list.
     f. Marking a Task as Completed: The `markAsCompleted()` function marks an active task as completed and moves it to the completed task list.
     g. Marking a Completed Task as Uncompleted: The `uncompletedTask()` function moves a completed task back to the active task list.
     h. Saving Data to Local Storage: The application uses `localStorage` to store the tasks locally, allowing the data to persist across page refreshes.
  
4. Task Styling:
   - The code defines different styles for tasks based on their state (active, completed) and assigns specific classes to them accordingly. These styles differentiate between tasks and improve the user experience.

Overall, the code provides a functional and interactive To-Do List application that users can use to manage their tasks effectively. It allows users to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks, making it a handy tool for organizing daily activities and deadlines.
